# Assignment 13

## Introduction
In this assignment, I am experimenting with HTMX and GitHub Copilot. I want to learn to be a fast and effective full stack developer that can quickly create awesome sites. This site is a single-paged app. I was going to use Firebase Functions to serve the HTML via GET calls, but I couldn't figure out how to get past the CORS errors :( .

## Purpose
I used to be a window cleaner for this company called [The Window Washers](http://www.thewindowwashers.net), and I have always been shocked that they still use such an outdated site. This Sunday's project is a quick, one day overhaul.

## Technologies
This project includes:
- Media queries to change the theme based on the browser's preferences
- Canvas to show the company name and slogan (not sure what else to use a canvas for)
- HTMX to make this website a single page app
- A nav menu
  - Note: I didn't like it scrolling with the screen, so it's static
- Responsive design with animated hover effects
