# Assignment 1

This assignment demonstrates some basic stuff about the markdown language.

## Styling

Text can be both *italic* or **bold** by being surrounded by one or two astrics `*` respectively.

Code can be displayed in blocks by being surrounded by three backticks and a language specifier.

``` python
# Python code example
import math

# Round up foo as bar
foo = 1.1
bar = math.ceil(foo)

# Print bar
print(bar)
```

You can mimic a CLI with the `>` symbol before a line (eg. ping my firebase server).
> curl <https://helloworld-xdo7f45bxa-uc.a.run.app>

## Links

Links can be relative to a repository.

- [Relative link to test.py](test.py)

Links can also lead to external websites like my other github projects.

- [Website of my exchange university](https://www.tugraz.at/home)
