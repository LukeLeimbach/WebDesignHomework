# Assignment 1

This assignment demonstrates some basic stuff about the .md markup language.

## Styling

Text can be both *italic* or **bold** by being surrounded by one or two astrics `*` respectively.

Code can be displayed in blocks by being surrounded by three backticks and a language specifier.

``` python
# Python code example
import math

# Round up foo as bar
foo = 1.1
bar = math.ceil(foo)

# Print bar
print(bar)
```
